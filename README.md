# Real Time Fur in WebGL SEDDI

* You can check this demo on the webpage. Works in latest navigators. https://aespinosadev.github.io/WebGL-RealTimeFur-SEDDI/
* Comb fur functionality and completely customizable!
* This project is being migrated to ThreeJS platform. Future improvements will be added to this other repository. https://github.com/AEspinosaDev/ThreeJS-RealTimeFur-SEDDI.git
* In the next few months a memory will be added explaining the ins and outs of this project.

<h4>The implemented fur rendering method is described in this paper: https://hhoppe.com/fur.pdf.</h4>

For rendering shells it uses WebGL instance rendering, fins are precomputed at mesh load and combing is achieved using transform feedbacks where new hair direction is computed and stored.



<h2>Future improvements</h2> 

  * Better image sampling for less aliasing. (specially in sub-pixel fin rendering)

  * Use geometric hair model to sample shell and fins textures on the fly. (Right now it uses a procedural perlin noise texture computed on the fly for the shell texture    and a precomputed fin texture)

  * Use a better shading algorythm. (Right now uses a slightly modified KajiyaÂ´s method, which is not physically based and has a lot of short-commings)

* Support for mobile-phones.
